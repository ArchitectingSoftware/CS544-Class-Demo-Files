# WebRTC Lab and Asynchronous Assignment

### Introduction

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) serves as an instructive example of application-layer protocol design that orchestrates multiple underlying protocols to enable peer-to-peer communication across the internet. Unlike traditional transport protocols focused on single concerns, WebRTC operates as a meta-protocol that coordinates ICE for NAT traversal, SDP for session negotiation, DTLS for security, SCTP for data channels, and RTP/SRTP for media streaming. This multi-protocol approach demonstrates how application-layer designs can abstract complexity while addressing real-world networking constraints like firewalls, NATs, and varying network conditions. By examining WebRTC, students observe how an application protocol makes intelligent decisions about connection paths, adapts to network limitations, provides fallback mechanisms, and maintains security throughout the communication process. The protocol's architecture illustrates key networking principles including protocol composition, signaling systems, and practical solutions to the asymmetric routing problems that characterize today's internet. WebRTC's design choices offer valuable insights into the tradeoffs and engineering decisions required when building modern communication systems on top of existing internet infrastructure.
