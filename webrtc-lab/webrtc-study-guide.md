## Code Exploration Activities

The following activities will help you connect theory with practice by examining the provided code samples:

### Activity 1: Trace the SDP and ICE Interaction

**Objective:** Understand how SDP and ICE work together during connection establishment.

**Steps:**
1. In the `offerer.py` and `answerer.py` files, locate all code related to SDP creation, exchange, and processing.
2. Trace the flow of SDP information from generation to consumption.
3. Find where ICE candidates are gathered and processed.
4. Run the programs and examine the logs for the sequence of SDP and ICE events.

**Key Questions:**
- How does SDP describe the session and media capabilities?
- At what point are ICE candidates gathered? 
- How are ICE candidates incorporated into or related to SDP?
- Why does the connection process need both SDP and ICE?

### Activity 2: Analyze TURN Server Usage Scenarios

**Objective:** Understand when TURN is necessary and the tradeoffs involved.

**Steps:**
1. Note that the provided samples don't explicitly use TURN servers.
2. Look for the ICE candidate types in the connection logs.
3. Examine the code where ICE candidates are processed.

**Key Questions:**
- What types of ICE candidates do you see in the logs? (host, srflx, relay)
- Under what network conditions would a TURN server be necessary?
- What are the disadvantages of using a TURN server?
- How would you modify the code to use a TURN server?

### Activity 3: Compare RTP and SCTP Implementations

**Objective:** Understand the different transport protocols used for media vs. data.

**Steps:**
1. In `video-webrtc.py`, examine how video frames are generated and transmitted.
2. In `offerer.py`/`answerer.py`, look at how data channels are established.
3. Compare SDP content for media sessions vs. data-only sessions.

**Key Questions:**
- What transport protocol carries video/audio media? What protocol carries data messages?
- Why are different protocols used for these different types of content?
- How does the code handle timing and delivery for video frames?
- How does the data channel code handle message reliability?

### Activity 4: Exploring WebRTC Architecture Decisions

**Objective:** Understand why WebRTC was designed as a collection of protocols.

**Steps:**
1. Review all the different protocol markers in the logs (`SDP`, `ICE`, `DTLS`, `RTC`, `DATACHANNEL`).
2. For each protocol, identify its specific role in the code.
3. Look for dependencies between protocols in the connection sequence.

**Key Questions:**
- What unique function does each protocol serve?
- How do these protocols interact with each other?
- What would be challenging about combining these functionalities into a single protocol?
- How does this modular approach benefit WebRTC's flexibility and adaptability?

### Activity 5: Analyzing Peer-to-Peer Benefits in the Code

**Objective:** Understand the advantages of WebRTC's peer-to-peer architecture.

**Steps:**
1. Note how the offerer and answerer directly communicate after signaling.
2. Trace the data flow once the connection is established.
3. Observe latency patterns in the logs.

**Key Questions:**
- After the initial signaling, what server components are still involved in the communication?
- How is media data routed between peers in the video demo?
- What latency benefits do you observe from the direct connection?
- What security measures protect the peer-to-peer communication?

## Advanced Code Exploration

For deeper understanding, try these more challenging investigations:

### Investigation 1: DTLS and Security Implementation

Examine how WebRTC secures connections:

1. Find the DTLS fingerprints in the SDP messages in the logs.
2. Trace how certificates are used in the connection process.
3. Identify where encryption is applied to media and data.

**Reflection Question:** How does WebRTC ensure security in peer-to-peer connections without a central authentication server?

### Investigation 2: Media Quality and Adaptation

Explore how WebRTC handles media quality:

1. In `video-webrtc.py`, examine the `TestVideoStreamTrack` class.
2. Look at how frames are timed and scheduled.
3. Identify where you could implement adaptive quality.

**Reflection Question:** How would you modify the code to adapt video quality based on network conditions?

### Investigation 3: Protocol Layering

Analyze the layered approach in WebRTC:

1. Map each protocol to its corresponding OSI layer:
   - ICE/STUN/TURN (Network layer assistance)
   - DTLS (Security layer)
   - SCTP/RTP (Transport layer)
   - Data Channel/Media (Application layer)

2. Trace how data flows through these layers in the code.

**Reflection Question:** How does this layered approach allow flexibility and reuse of standard protocols?
